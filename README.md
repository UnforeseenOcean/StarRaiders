## Fully documented, reverse-engineered STAR RAIDERS source code

During the last years, as a hobby afterhours project, I reverse-engineered a complete, extensively documented assembly language source code of STAR RAIDERS for the Atari 8-bit Home Computer System. I created it directly from the binary file of the ROM cartridge, finishing it in September 2015.

You may find it useful if you are curious about the internals of STAR RAIDERS or if you are planning to make your own, modified version.

After very positive reader feedback on the initial release of my reverse-engineered source code I reviewed it again, resulting in a minor update.

PS: I was absolutely thrilled to learn that in October 2015 [scans of the original STAR RAIDERS source code](https://archive.org/details/AtariStarRaidersSourceCode) re-surfaced.

To my delight, inspection of the original source code confirmed the findings of my reverse-engineered version and caused only a few trivial corrections.

Even more, the documentation of my reverse-engineered version adds a substantial amount of information - from overall theory of operation down to some tricky details - to the understanding of the often sparsely commented original (quite expected for source code never meant for publication). So, if you are interested in learing how STAR RAIDERS works, my reverse-engineered source code could be of help to you.
